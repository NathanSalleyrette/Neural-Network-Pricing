Copy-paste network.json, input.csv and gradient.csv from the 'Basic' folder into the same folder as PropagationComparison.exe
Open a powershell (or a command prompt) and execute '.\PropagationComparison.exe .\network.json .\input.csv .\gradient.csv'
You will obtain a json output containing the outputs of the network after the first and second forward propagations.
